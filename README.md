# Notes

repo containing notes and templates for my notes.
currently using nvim+vimtex+zathura for note taking.

A lot of the code is from the following sources:
1. https://github.com/tecosaur/BMC
2. https://github.com/lambdasolver/LaTeX
3. https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/master/latex_template


To use:
1. Copy the template directory to the same directory as your LaTeX file.
	
	```bash
	$ cp ./letterfonts.tex ./macros.tex ./preamble.tex ./template.tex [some_dir]
	```
	
2. Edit the file "template.tex" to your liking.
